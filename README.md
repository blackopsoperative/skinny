# skinny

Python port of [Cazzwastaken's skin changer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OV5RtbhUhk) using code from his [Python BHop script video as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eK1-GyFQNc)<br>
⚠️ Basically a 1:1 copy of Cazz's CPP code but without the memory class and all that jazz. Code has not been ran on a machine as of this time because I do not have CS:GO installed. One of those things where you're gonna have to use this at your own discretion before I can properly test it out. ⚠️
